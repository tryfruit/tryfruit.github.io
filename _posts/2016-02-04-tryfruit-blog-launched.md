We wanted to log our journey with tryFruit so I we've set up this blog. 
Neat thing about it that it only took 5 minutes.
It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) that runs on GitHub and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Here's a great [step by step guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) that I'd recommend.
