Today we tried to explain how we've reached a decision and we've got a bit mixed up.

To get on the same page we identified different phases when working with ideas:

1. idea generation
2. idea selection
3. idea mapping
4. idea optimization

Reflecting on this, we figured that 

* we tend to jump back and forth between these phases when busy
* stating in an argument the phase we think we are right now helps a lot

The main takeaway for us was that we use specific tools sometimes in a not-so-traditional fashion *(e.g. landing page tests when mapping out ideas to have more input for the idea selection phase)*.
