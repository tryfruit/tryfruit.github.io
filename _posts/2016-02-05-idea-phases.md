Today we tried to explain how we've reached a decision and we've got a bit mixed up.

To get on the same page we identified different phases when working with ideas:

1. idea generation
2. idea selection
3. idea mapping
4. idea optimization

Reflecting on this, we figured that we tend to jump back and forth between these phases.

Different tools have variable effectiveness and efficiency when used in different settings. 

Stating in an argument the phase we think we are right now helps a lot to have a clearer view.
